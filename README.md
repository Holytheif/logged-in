Web Authentication App that utilises JWT and SSH256 for security of data. Created with neo-brutalism design in back of the mind.

**Beware of sharing your private data while testing** (_unless ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ_)

Have a look at some of the packages:

-   **Axios** for making those secure requests to server.
-   **CryptoJS** for hashing user password on client side before sending to server.
-   **jsonwebtoken** for generating token to allow login functionality.
